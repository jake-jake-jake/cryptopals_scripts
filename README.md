# cryptopals_scripts

Likely, boring for everyone but me.

## Set 1

I started doing these not exactly sure how to go about operating on bytes in Python. So, I had a few redundant imports of both base64 and binascii in the crypotools.py file. I'm now cleaning that up so that all of the translations between base64 encodings and bytestrings is done by the binascii module. I recently refactored all the code for these, with the exception of Challenge 6 (which seemed to be working more or less well enough), to make them work from the command line. Previously they may have required execution in IDLE. 

## Set 2

Ooo, block cipher, exciting.
